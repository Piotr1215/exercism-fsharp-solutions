# Exercism - my solutions for fsharp language track

[Exercism](exercism.io) is an amazing open source learning platform providing code challenges for over 52 languages (and growing).

Exercises are organized in form of "tracks" and after completing each exercise a mentor is picks it up from a queue and provides very helpful comments which helps a lot with learning.

In this repo you I have put together exercises and my solutions to them.

## Prerequisites

- .NET Core SDK
- Visual Studio Code with [Ionide Plugin](http://ionide.io/)
- [Windows](https://fsharp.org/use/windows/)
  - If you choose to install Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 only, make sure to select "F# compiler" option from "Individual components" section
  - Add fsi.exe location to PATH variable: **C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\BuildTools\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\FSharp**
- [Linux](https://fsharp.org/use/linux/)
- [MacOS](https://fsharp.org/use/mac/)

You can follow along with the exercises by selecting code in *.fsx file and using Alt+Enter to run in FSI
